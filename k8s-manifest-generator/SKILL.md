# Kubernetes Manifest Generator

Step-by-step guidance for creating production-ready Kubernetes manifests including Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and PersistentVolumeClaims.

## Use this skill when

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create new Kubernetes Deployment manifests
- Define Service resources for network connectivity
- Generate ConfigMap and Secret resources for configuration management
- Create PersistentVolumeClaim manifests for stateful workloads
- Follow Kubernetes best practices and naming conventions
- Implement resource limits, health checks, and security contexts
- Design manifests for multi-environment deployments

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to kubernetes manifest generator
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Anti-Patterns

- NEVER commit raw secrets or API keys to infrastructure code repositories.
- NEVER deploy resources without setting clear resource limits (CPU/Memory/storage quotas).

## 6) Capture Knowledge


## Memory Sync

After completing key technical findings, architectural decisions, code refactorings, or risk assessments, you **MUST** trigger the local memory capture.

1. Save the final summary or artifact as a Markdown file in the project directory.
2. Invoke the capture script:
   ```bash
   python3 ~/memory_system/capture_knowledge.py <file_path>
   ```
3. This ensures that new learnings, policies, and technical snippets are automatically routed to the correct local storage (OKF or ChromaDB).

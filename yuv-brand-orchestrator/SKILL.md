## When to Use
Use for any request involving YUV.AI branded output, including presentations (decks), design system assets, brand strategy, or viral video creation.

## Procedure
1. Identify the requested YUV.AI output medium: Presentation Deck, Web/App UI, Pilot/Strategic Plan, or Viral Video.
2. For Presentation Decks: Use `yuv-decks` to scaffold the 4-act narrative arc (Boarding, Ascent, Cruise, Descent) and apply the `yuv-design-system` brand tokens.
3. For Web/App UI: Apply the `yuv-design-system` NEON mode (pink/cyan/white) and ensure all components are accessible.
4. For Pilot/Strategic Plans: Use `yuv-pilot` to orchestrate multi-medium content across channels and handle strategic brand positioning.
5. For Viral Videos: Use `yuv-viral-video` to transform selfie or screen-share footage into high-paced, captioned shorts with liquid-glass cards and GSAP motion.
6. Synthesize all components into a unified brand experience, ensuring consistent typography (Anton/Inter) and color usage across all artifacts.

## Pitfalls
- Do not use the 'Warm Editorial' palette for web-facing apps; use 'NEON' for web and 'DECKS' for slides.
- Ensure all video content follows the 'liquid-glass' and 'liquid-blob' aesthetic constraints.
- Always verify that the 'Fly High' tagline and phoenix mark are present in all presentation decks.

## Verification
1. The final output follows the YUV.AI brand guidelines (typography, color, motifs).
2. Presentation decks follow the 4-act narrative structure.
3. Viral videos include both 9:16 and 16:9 versions with correct captioning.


## 6) Memory Sync

After completing a task, key decision, or report, you **MUST** trigger the local memory capture. 

1. Save the final document, report, or summary as a Markdown file in the project directory.
2. Invoke the capture script: 
   `ash
   python \capture_knowledge.py <file_path>
   `
3. This ensures that new requirements, technical standards, and findings are automatically routed to the correct storage (OKF or ChromaDB).

# Error Handling Patterns

Build resilient applications with robust error handling strategies that gracefully handle failures and provide excellent debugging experiences.

## Use this skill when

- Implementing error handling in new features
- Designing error-resilient APIs
- Debugging production issues
- Improving application reliability
- Creating better error messages for users and developers
- Implementing retry and circuit breaker patterns
- Handling async/concurrent errors
- Building fault-tolerant distributed systems

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to error handling patterns
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Anti-Patterns

- NEVER deploy code changes without validating them against target test suites.
- NEVER skip documenting non-obvious code assumptions, constraints, and side effects.


## Memory Sync

After completing key technical findings, architectural decisions, code refactorings, or risk assessments, you **MUST** trigger the local memory capture.

1. Save the final summary or artifact as a Markdown file in the project directory.
2. Invoke the capture script:
   ```bash
   python3 ~/memory_system/capture_knowledge.py <file_path>
   ```
3. This ensures that new learnings, policies, and technical snippets are automatically routed to the correct local storage (OKF or ChromaDB).

## When to Use
Use this skill when the user wants to deploy the ADR Gatekeeper system into a new project. It handles directory creation, file population, and CI/CD setup.

## Procedure
1. Create 'scripts/' and 'tools/' directories at the project root.
2. Write 'tools/adr_index.json' with the initial decision map.
3. Write 'tools/adr_analyst_config.json' with the significance rules.
4. Write 'tools/adr_analyst_prompt.txt' with the gatekeeper persona.
5. Write 'scripts/adr_gatekeeper.py' with the analysis engine.
6. Write '.github/workflows/adr-gatekeeper.yml' for CI/CD integration.
7. Create and configure the local '.git/hooks/pre-commit' hook.

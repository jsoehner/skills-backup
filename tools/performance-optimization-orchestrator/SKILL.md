## When to Use
Use for any task involving performance optimization, profiling, or tuning of databases, data pipelines, or vector search.

## Procedure
1. Identify the performance target: SQL, Spark, Vector Indices, or Application Profiling.
2. For SQL Optimization: Use `sql-optimization-patterns` and `spark-optimization` for database and data processing.
3. For Vector Index Tuning: Use `vector-index-tuning` to optimize semantic search performance.
4. For Application Profiling: Use `performance-engineer` and `performance-testing-review-ai-review` to identify and fix bottlenecks.
5. Synthesize the performance plan and validate improvements with benchmarks.

## Pitfalls
- Do not optimize for a single metric at the expense of overall system health.
- Ensure performance improvements are validated with benchmarks.
- Do not ignore the impact of optimizations on cost and complexity.

## Verification
1. Performance improvements are validated with measurable benchmarks.
2. Optimizations do not introduce new regressions or excessive complexity.
3. The performance plan is documented and shared with the team.


## 6) Memory Sync

After completing a task, key decision, or report, you **MUST** trigger the local memory capture. 

1. Save the final document, report, or summary as a Markdown file in the project directory.
2. Invoke the capture script: 
   `ash
   python \capture_knowledge.py <file_path>
   `
3. This ensures that new requirements, technical standards, and findings are automatically routed to the correct storage (OKF or ChromaDB).

# Track Manager

Manage the complete track lifecycle including archiving, restoring, deleting, renaming, and cleaning up orphaned artifacts.

## Use this skill when

- Archiving, restoring, renaming, or deleting Conductor tracks
- Listing track status or cleaning orphaned artifacts
- Managing the track lifecycle across active, completed, and archived states

## Do not use this skill when

- Conductor is not initialized in the repository
- You lack permission to modify track metadata or files
- The task is unrelated to Conductor track management

## Instructions

- Verify `conductor/` structure and required files before proceeding.
- Determine the operation mode from arguments or interactive prompts.
- Confirm destructive actions (delete/cleanup) before applying.
- Update `tracks.md` and metadata consistently.
- If detailed steps are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Safety

- Backup track data before delete operations.
- Avoid removing archived tracks without explicit approval.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed modes, prompts, and workflows.

## Anti-Patterns

- NEVER deploy code changes without validating them against target test suites.
- NEVER skip documenting non-obvious code assumptions, constraints, and side effects.


## Memory Sync

After completing key technical findings, architectural decisions, code refactorings, or risk assessments, you **MUST** trigger the local memory capture.

1. Save the final summary or artifact as a Markdown file in the project directory.
2. Invoke the capture script:
   ```bash
   python3 ~/memory_system/capture_knowledge.py <file_path>
   ```
3. This ensures that new learnings, policies, and technical snippets are automatically routed to the correct local storage (OKF or ChromaDB).

# Hybrid Search Implementation

Patterns for combining vector similarity and keyword-based search.

## Use this skill when

- Building RAG systems with improved recall
- Combining semantic understanding with exact matching
- Handling queries with specific terms (names, codes)
- Improving search for domain-specific vocabulary
- When pure vector search misses keyword matches

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to hybrid search implementation
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Anti-Patterns

- NEVER deploy code changes without validating them against target test suites.
- NEVER skip documenting non-obvious code assumptions, constraints, and side effects.

## 6) Memory Sync

Execute the following steps to sync knowledge to the memory system:
1. Use `capture_knowledge.py` to route information to the correct storage (OKF or ChromaDB).
2. Ensure that high-level architectural rules, policies, and decisions are stored in the OKF (Open Knowledge Format) directory.
3. Ensure that ephemeral data, logs, and specific technical notes are stored in the ChromaDB instance.
4. Verify that the `MEMORY_SYSTEM_ROOT` and `MEMORY_INBOX_DIR` environment variables are correctly configured.

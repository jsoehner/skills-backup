# Competitive Landscape Analysis

Comprehensive frameworks for analyzing competition, identifying differentiation opportunities, and developing winning market positioning strategies.

## Use this skill when

- Working on competitive landscape analysis tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for competitive landscape analysis

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to competitive landscape analysis
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Knowledge Capture Requirement
When performing tasks that involve architectural decisions, significant engineering trade-offs, or complex infrastructure changes, you MUST use the `capture_knowledge.py` script to persist the information.

- **Policy/High-Level Decisions**: Use `python3 capture_knowledge.py --type okf` to save to the Open Knowledge Framework (OKF).
- **Technical Context/Implementation Details**: Use `python3 capture_knowledge.py --type chroma` to save to the contextual memory (ChromaDB).

Ensure that the captured content is deduplicated (the script handles this via hashing) and correctly chunked.

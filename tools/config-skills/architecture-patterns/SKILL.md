# Architecture Patterns

Master proven backend architecture patterns including Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture, and Domain-Driven Design to build maintainable, testable, and scalable systems.

## Use this skill when

- Designing new backend systems from scratch
- Refactoring monolithic applications for better maintainability
- Establishing architecture standards for your team
- Migrating from tightly coupled to loosely coupled architectures
- Implementing domain-driven design principles
- Creating testable and mockable codebases
- Planning microservices decomposition

## Do not use this skill when

- You only need small, localized refactors
- The system is primarily frontend with no backend architecture changes
- You need implementation details without architectural design

## Instructions

1. Clarify domain boundaries, constraints, and scalability targets.
2. Select an architecture pattern that fits the domain complexity.
3. Define module boundaries, interfaces, and dependency rules.
4. Provide migration steps and validation checks.

Refer to `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.

## Anti-Patterns

- NEVER violate dependency rules in Clean/Hexagonal Architecture (e.g., outer layer infrastructure details must not bleed into core domains).
- NEVER expose internal domain entities directly through public web APIs.

## 6) Memory Sync

After an architectural pattern selection, design blueprint, or refactoring plan is completed, you **MUST** trigger the local memory capture. 

1. Save the final architecture blueprint, refactoring plan, or pattern selection as a Markdown file in the project directory.
2. Invoke the capture script: 
   ```bash
   python $MEMORY_SYSTEM_ROOT\capture_knowledge.py <file_path>
   ```
3. This ensures that architectural patterns, design blueprints, and refactoring plans are automatically routed to the correct storage (OKF or ChromaDB).

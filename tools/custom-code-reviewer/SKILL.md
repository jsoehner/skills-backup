## Use this skill when
- Reviewing code for local development (staged or working tree changes).
- Reviewing remote Pull Requests (via PR ID or URL).
- Needing high-level architectural guidance, security audits (OWASP), or performance optimization advice.
- Seeking best practices for maintainability, testability, and production reliability.

## Do not use this skill when
- The task is unrelated to code review or software engineering quality.
- You need a specific tool that is outside the scope of code analysis (e.g., infrastructure provisioning).

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Review Target
- **Remote PR**: If the user provides a PR number or URL (e.g., "Review PR #123"), target that remote PR.
- **Local Changes**: If no specific PR is mentioned, or if the user asks to "review my changes", target the current local file system states (staged and unstaged changes).

### 2. Preparation
#### For Remote PRs:
1. **Checkout**: Use the GitHub CLI to checkout the PR.
   ```bash
   gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER>
   ```
2. **Preflight**: Execute the project's standard verification suite to catch automated failures early.
   ```bash
   npm run preflight
   ```
3. **Context**: Read the PR description and any existing comments to understand the goal and history.

#### For Local Changes:
1. **Identify Changes**:
   - Check status: `git status`
   - Read diffs: `git diff` (working tree) and/or `git diff --staged` (staged).
2. **Preflight (Optional)**: If the changes are substantial, ask the user if they want to run `npm run preflight` before reviewing.

### 3. In-Depth Analysis
Analyze the code changes based on the following pillars:
- **Correctness**: Does the code achieve its stated purpose without bugs or logical errors?
- **Maintainability**: Is the code clean, well-structured, and easy to understand and modify in the future?
- **Readability**: Is the code well-commented and consistently formatted according to project guidelines?
- **Efficiency**: Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks or resource inefficiencies?
- **Security**: Are there any potential security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10, input validation, auth, secrets)?
- **Edge Cases and Error Handling**: Does the code appropriately handle edge cases and potential errors?
- **Testability**: Is the new or modified code adequately covered by tests? Suggest additional test cases.

### 4. Feedback & Closure
#### Structure & Tone
- **Summary**: A high-level overview of the review.
- **Findings**: Categorized as **Critical**, **Improvements**, and **Nitpicks**.
- **Conclusion**: Clear recommendation (Approved / Request Changes).
- **Suggestions**: Provide specific code examples and alternatives.
- **Tone**: Be constructive, professional, and friendly. Explain *why* a change is requested. For approvals, acknowledge the specific value of the contribution.

#### Documentation & Follow-up
- **Document Decisions**: Explain rationale for complex review points.
- **Follow-up**: Provide continuous guidance on implementation.

### 5. Cleanup (Remote PRs only)
- After the review, ask the user if they want to switch back to the default branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).

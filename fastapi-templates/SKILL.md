# FastAPI Project Templates

Production-ready FastAPI project structures with async patterns, dependency injection, middleware, and best practices for building high-performance APIs.

## Use this skill when

- Starting new FastAPI projects from scratch
- Implementing async REST APIs with Python
- Building high-performance web services and microservices
- Creating async applications with PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Setting up API projects with proper structure and testing

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to fastapi project templates
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Knowledge Capture Requirement
When performing tasks that involve architectural decisions, significant engineering trade-offs, or complex infrastructure changes, you MUST use the `capture_knowledge.py` script to persist the information.

- **Policy/High-Level Decisions**: Use `python3 capture_knowledge.py --type okf` to save to the Open Knowledge Framework (OKF).
- **Technical Context/Implementation Details**: Use `python3 capture_knowledge.py --type chroma` to save to the contextual memory (ChromaDB).

Ensure that the captured content is deduplicated (the script handles this via hashing) and correctly chunked.

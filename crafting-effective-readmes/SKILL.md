# Crafting Effective READMEs



## Overview



READMEs answer questions your audience will have. Different audiences need different information - a contributor to an OSS project needs different context than future-you opening a config folder.



**Always ask:** Who will read this, and what do they need to know?



## Process



### Step 1: Identify the Task



**Ask:** "What README task are you working on?"



| Task | When |

|------|------|

| **Creating** | New project, no README yet |

| **Adding** | Need to document something new |

| **Updating** | Capabilities changed, content is stale |

| **Reviewing** | Checking if README is still accurate |



### Step 2: Task-Specific Questions



**Creating initial README:**

1. What type of project? (see Project Types below)

2. What problem does this solve in one sentence?

3. What's the quickest path to "it works"?

4. Anything notable to highlight?



**Adding a section:**

1. What needs documenting?

2. Where should it go in the existing structure?

3. Who needs this info most?



**Updating existing content:**

1. What changed?

2. Read current README, identify stale sections

3. Propose specific edits



**Reviewing/refreshing:**

1. Read current README

2. Check against actual project state (package.json, main files, etc.)

3. Flag outdated sections

4. Update "Last reviewed" date if present



### Step 3: Always Ask



After drafting, ask: **"Anything else to highlight or include that I might have missed?"**



## Project Types



| Type | Audience | Key Sections | Template |

|------|----------|--------------|----------|

| **Open Source** | Contributors, users worldwide | Install, Usage, Contributing, License | `templates/oss.md` |

| **Personal** | Future you, portfolio viewers | What it does, Tech stack, Learnings | `templates/personal.md` |

| **Internal** | Teammates, new hires | Setup, Architecture, Runbooks | `templates/internal.md` |

| **Config** | Future you (confused) | What's here, Why, How to extend, Gotchas | `templates/xdg-config.md` |



**Ask the user** if unclear. Don't assume OSS defaults for everything.



## Essential Sections (All Types)



Every README needs at minimum:



1. **Name** - Self-explanatory title

2. **Description** - What + why in 1-2 sentences  

3. **Usage** - How to use it (examples help)



## Anti-Patterns



| Avoid | Why | Instead |

|-------|-----|---------|

| Vague/Stale Instructions | Misleads users, creates setup friction | Keep commands matching `package.json` |

| Empty Placeholder Sections | Looks unfinished and sloppy | Remove TBD sections entirely |

| Generic tutorials | Wastes tokens | Explain specific installation steps |



## References & Templates



**MANDATORY - LOADING TRIGGERS**:

- Once the user confirms the project type, you **MUST** read the corresponding template file, such as `templates/internal.md` or `templates/oss.md`.

- Before editing or formatting, you **MUST** read [style-guide.md](references/style-guide.md) to inspect common phrasing errors.

- **Do NOT load** external templates or references for simple config README files.

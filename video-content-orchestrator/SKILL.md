## When to Use

Use for any task involving video content production, including downloading, editing, and creating video-based landing pages.



## Procedure

1. Identify the video task: Download, Edit, or Landing Page Creation.

2. For Downloading: Use `video-downloader` to fetch content from supported platforms.

3. For Editing: Use `video-edit` to apply captions, liquid-glass effects, and GSAP motion.

4. For Landing Pages: Use `video-to-landing-page` to create a scroll-driven hero section from a video clip.

5. Synthesize the final video asset and ensure it meets the target platform's specifications.



## Pitfalls

- Ensure video files are in supported formats (mp4, mov, mkv).

- Check that the system has enough storage for high-resolution video processing.

- Verify that all captions are correctly synchronized with the audio stem.



## Verification

1. The video file is correctly rendered and playable.

2. Captions are synchronized and visually consistent with the brand style.

3. The landing page correctly scrubs the video frames on scroll.

# CQRS Implementation

Comprehensive guide to implementing CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) patterns.

## Use this skill when

- Separating read and write concerns
- Scaling reads independently from writes
- Building event-sourced systems
- Optimizing complex query scenarios
- Different read/write data models are needed
- High-performance reporting is required

## Do not use this skill when

- The domain is simple and CRUD is sufficient
- You cannot operate separate read/write models
- Strong immediate consistency is required everywhere

## Instructions

- Identify read/write workloads and consistency needs.
- Define command and query models with clear boundaries.
- Implement read model projections and synchronization.
- Validate performance, recovery, and failure modes.
- If detailed patterns are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed CQRS patterns and templates.

## Anti-Patterns

- NEVER deploy code changes without validating them against target test suites.
- NEVER skip documenting non-obvious code assumptions, constraints, and side effects.


## Memory Sync

After completing key technical findings, architectural decisions, code refactorings, or risk assessments, you **MUST** trigger the local memory capture.

1. Save the final summary or artifact as a Markdown file in the project directory.
2. Invoke the capture script:
   ```bash
   python3 ~/memory_system/capture_knowledge.py <file_path>
   ```
3. This ensures that new learnings, policies, and technical snippets are automatically routed to the correct local storage (OKF or ChromaDB).

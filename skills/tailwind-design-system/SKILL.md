# Tailwind Design System

Build production-ready design systems with Tailwind CSS, including design tokens, component variants, responsive patterns, and accessibility.

## Use this skill when

- Creating a component library with Tailwind
- Implementing design tokens and theming
- Building responsive and accessible components
- Standardizing UI patterns across a codebase
- Migrating to or extending Tailwind CSS
- Setting up dark mode and color schemes

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to tailwind design system
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Anti-Patterns

- NEVER load massive datasets directly into client memory; use pagination or infinite scroll.
- NEVER use generic, unstyled components or default browser styling in production-ready UIs.

## 6) Capture Knowledge


## Memory Sync

After completing key technical findings, architectural decisions, code refactorings, or risk assessments, you **MUST** trigger the local memory capture.

1. Save the final summary or artifact as a Markdown file in the project directory.
2. Invoke the capture script:
   ```bash
   python3 ~/memory_system/capture_knowledge.py <file_path>
   ```
3. This ensures that new learnings, policies, and technical snippets are automatically routed to the correct local storage (OKF or ChromaDB).

# Python Packaging

Comprehensive guide to creating, structuring, and distributing Python packages using modern packaging tools, pyproject.toml, and publishing to PyPI.

## Use this skill when

- Creating Python libraries for distribution
- Building command-line tools with entry points
- Publishing packages to PyPI or private repositories
- Setting up Python project structure
- Creating installable packages with dependencies
- Building wheels and source distributions
- Versioning and releasing Python packages
- Creating namespace packages
- Implementing package metadata and classifiers

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to python packaging
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Anti-Patterns

- NEVER perform blocking synchronous operations inside asynchronous event loops.
- NEVER run python applications without pinning exact dependencies in requirements or pyproject files.


## Memory Sync

After completing key technical findings, architectural decisions, code refactorings, or risk assessments, you **MUST** trigger the local memory capture.

1. Save the final summary or artifact as a Markdown file in the project directory.
2. Invoke the capture script:
   ```bash
   python3 ~/memory_system/capture_knowledge.py <file_path>
   ```
3. This ensures that new learnings, policies, and technical snippets are automatically routed to the correct local storage (OKF or ChromaDB).

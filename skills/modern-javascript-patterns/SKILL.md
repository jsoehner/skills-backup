# Modern JavaScript Patterns

Comprehensive guide for mastering modern JavaScript (ES6+) features, functional programming patterns, and best practices for writing clean, maintainable, and performant code.

## Use this skill when

- Refactoring legacy JavaScript to modern syntax
- Implementing functional programming patterns
- Optimizing JavaScript performance
- Writing maintainable and readable code
- Working with asynchronous operations
- Building modern web applications
- Migrating from callbacks to Promises/async-await
- Implementing data transformation pipelines

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to modern javascript patterns
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Anti-Patterns

- NEVER run shell scripts with unquoted variable expansions.
- NEVER use eval on untrusted user inputs.


## Memory Sync

After completing key technical findings, architectural decisions, code refactorings, or risk assessments, you **MUST** trigger the local memory capture.

1. Save the final summary or artifact as a Markdown file in the project directory.
2. Invoke the capture script:
   ```bash
   python3 ~/memory_system/capture_knowledge.py <file_path>
   ```
3. This ensures that new learnings, policies, and technical snippets are automatically routed to the correct local storage (OKF or ChromaDB).

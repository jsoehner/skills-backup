# Workflow Patterns

Guide for implementing tasks using Conductor's TDD workflow, managing phase checkpoints, handling git commits, and executing the verification protocol that ensures quality throughout implementation.

## Use this skill when

- Implementing tasks from a track's plan.md
- Following TDD red-green-refactor cycle
- Completing phase checkpoints
- Managing git commits and notes
- Understanding quality assurance gates
- Handling verification protocols
- Recording progress in plan files

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to workflow patterns
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Anti-Patterns

- NEVER deploy code changes without validating them against target test suites.
- NEVER skip documenting non-obvious code assumptions, constraints, and side effects.


## 6) Memory Sync

After completing a task, key decision, or report, you **MUST** trigger the local memory capture. 

1. Save the final document, report, or summary as a Markdown file in the project directory.
2. Invoke the capture script: 
   `ash
   python \capture_knowledge.py <file_path>
   `
3. This ensures that new requirements, technical standards, and findings are automatically routed to the correct storage (OKF or ChromaDB).
